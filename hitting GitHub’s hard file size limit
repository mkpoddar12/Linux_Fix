You're hitting GitHubâ€™s hard file size limit â€” it refuses to accept any file over 100 MB, and this file:

.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/...terraform-provider-aws_v5.94.1_x5.exe
is 670 MB, which is way too large to push.

ðŸ”¥ Quick Fix (Don't push .terraform/ folder at all)
These provider files are automatically downloaded by Terraform, so there's no need to commit them.

âœ… Step 1: Add .terraform/ to .gitignore
If not already done, create or update your .gitignore file like this:

.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
*.log
crash.log

âœ… Step 2: Remove from Git tracking
Run these commands to unstage and remove .terraform from Git history:

git rm -r --cached .terraform/
Then:


git commit -m "Remove .terraform directory from Git tracking"

âœ… Step 3: Push again

git push origin main

âœ… Bonus Tip: Use .gitignore at the start of every Terraform repo to avoid this in future
Let me know if you want a full .gitignore template for Terraform projects.
